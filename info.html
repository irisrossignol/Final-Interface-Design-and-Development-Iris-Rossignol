      <h2>PROMPT AND TECHNIQUE :</h2>
      <p class="info">
        My first idea was to use the prompt "Skeuomorphism" because it was a
        prompt that inspired me. I decided to make a known game concept, I
        hesitated between Tic Tac Toe, Connect Four or chess and I chose Tic Tac
        Toe because it was the game that seemed the most accessible for me. I
        had trouble deciding on an aesthetic for my project and while trying
        different typographies I came across Chalkduster, a typo that looks like
        chalk and I had the idea of ​​making my Tic Tac Toe with the aesthetic
        of a chalk board with a slightly childish vision.

      <h2>TECHNICAL APPROACH TO IMPLEMENTATION :</h2>
      <p class="info">
        I really wanted to add a math.random in my code because it's the first
        code that struck me and I really like randomization. For the website
        implementation I put the player interaction, each player can either an X
        or an O and the first one who makes a line of three X or three O wins.
        Each time a player places his shape, the grid makes a sound, each cell
        makes a different sound. I had previously put my math.random on the
        letters X and O but after feedbacks I decided to change my math.random
        and put it on the colors of the texts on the right and left of my site.
        To replace the color of the X and O I chose to give the option to the
        players to choose between 5 colors of chalk for their shape. And finally
        we have the Restart button, which resets the game to 0, which changes
        the colors of the texts on the right and left and which resets the
        original chalk colors (red for the X, blue for the O).
      </p>
      <h2>PROMPTS AND FEEDBACKS</h2>
      <p class="info">
        My two prompts were: <br> 1. Are the colors of the letters too distracting?
         <br>2. Is the interface interesting and visually appealing, or does it feel
        too empty? </br>For the first, the answers were kind of mixed: half yes, half
        no. A few people said that the fact that all the Xs and Os weren't the
        same color was quite distracting (although others said it wasn't
        distracting since they were focused on the game). I wanted to add a
        math.random on these letters and differentiate them by putting different
        colors for each (the Xs are yellow/orange/red and the Os
        blue/purple/green). I thought that would be enough to distinguish the Xs
        and Os, but apparently not for everyone. To solve this problem I decided
        to move the math random to the right and left sentences of my game and
        to let the players choose their color for the game. For the second
        prompt, some people were saying that the site was a little empty in
        terms of interaction so I added the choice of chalks and some reviews
        also advised me to make the game bigger which was done.
